<p><strong>Information Flow-Based Causality</strong></p>
<p><em>Liang (2016) Abstract</em></p>
<p>Information flow or information transfer the widely applicable
general physics notion can be rigorously derived
from first principles, rather than axiomatically proposed as an ansatz.
Its logical association with causality is firmly rooted in the dynamical
system that lies beneath.
The principle of nil causality that reads, an event is not causal to another
if the evolution of the latter is independent of the former,
which transfer entropy analysis and Granger causality test fail to verify
in many situations, turns out to be a proven theorem here.</p>
<p>Established in this study are the information flows among the components of
time-discrete mappings and time-continuous dynamical systems,
both deterministic and stochastic.
They have been obtained explicitly in closed form, and put to applications
with the benchmark systems such as the Kaplan-Yorke map, Rössler system,
baker transformation, Hénon map, and stochastic potential flow.</p>
<p>Besides unraveling the causal relations as expected from the respective systems,
some of the applications show that the information flow structure underlying a
complex trajectory pattern could be tractable.</p>
<p>For linear systems, the resulting remarkably concise formula asserts analytically that
causation implies correlation,
while correlation does not imply causation,
providing a mathematical basis for the long-standing philosophical debate
over causation versus correlation.</p>

<p><em>Liang (2021) Abstract</em></p>
<p>Causality analysis is an important problem lying at the heart of science, and is of particular
importance in data science and machine learning. An endeavor during the past 16 years viewing
causality as a real physical notion so as to formulate it from first principles, however, seems to
have gone unnoticed. This study introduces to the community this line of work, with a long-due
generalization of the information flow-based bivariate time series causal inference to multivariate
series, based on the recent advance in theoretical development. The resulting formula is transparent,
and can be implemented as a computationally very efficient algorithm for application. It can be
normalized and tested for statistical significance. Different from the previous work along this line
where only information flows are estimated, here an algorithm is also implemented to quantify the
influence of a unit to itself. While this forms a challenge in some causal inferences, here it comes
naturally, and hence the identification of self-loops in a causal graph is fulfilled automatically as the
causalities along edges are inferred. To demonstrate the power of the approach, presented here are
two applications in extreme situations. The first is a network of multivariate processes buried in
heavy noises (with the noise-to-signal ratio exceeding 100), and the second a network with nearly
synchronized chaotic oscillators. In both graphs, confounding processes exist. While it seems to be a
challenge to reconstruct from given series these causal graphs, an easy application of the algorithm
immediately reveals the desideratum. Particularly, the confounding processes have been accurately
differentiated. Considering the surge of interest in the community, this study is very timely.</p>

<p><em>Liang (2014) Abstract</em></p>
<p>Given two time series, can one faithfully tell, in a rigorous and
quantitative way, the cause and effect between them?
Based on a recently rigorized physical notion, namely, information flow,
we solve an inverse problem and give this important and challenging question,
which is of interest in a wide variety of disciplines, a positive answer.
Here causality is measured by the time rate of information flowing
from one series to the other.
The resulting formula is tight in form, involving only commonly used statistics,
namely, sample covariances;
an immediate corollary is that causation implies correlation,
but correlation does not imply causation.
It has been validated with touchstone linear and nonlinear series,
purportedly generated with one-way causality that evades the traditional approaches.
It has also been applied successfully to the investigation of real-world problems;
an example presented here is the cause-and-effect relation between
the two climate modes, El Niño and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD),
which have been linked to hazards in far-flung regions of the globe.
In general, the two modes are mutually causal, but the causality is asymmetric:
El Niño tends to stabilize IOD, while IOD functions to make El Niño more uncertain.
To El Niño, the information flowing from IOD manifests itself as a propagation
of uncertainty from the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p><em>Hagan (2019) Abstract</em></p>
<p>The interaction between the land surface and the atmosphere is of significant importance in the climate system because it is a key driver of the exchanges of energy and water. Several important relations to heat waves, floods, and droughts exist that are based on the interaction of soil moisture and, for instance, air temperature and humidity. Our ability to separate the elements of this coupling, identify the exact locations where they are strongest, and quantify their strengths is, therefore, of paramount importance to their predictability. A recent rigorous causality formalism based on the Liang–Kleeman (LK) information flow theory has been shown, both theoretically and in real-world applications, to have the necessary asymmetry to infer the directionality and magnitude within geophysical interactions. However, the formalism assumes stationarity in time, whereas the interactions within the land surface and atmosphere are generally nonstationary; furthermore, it requires a sufficiently long time series to ensure statistical sufficiency. In this study, we remedy this difficulty by using the square root Kalman filter to estimate the causality based on the LK formalism to derive a time-varying form. Results show that the new formalism has similar properties compared to its time-invariant form. It is shown that it is also able to capture the time-varying causality structure within soil moisture–air temperature coupling. An advantage is that it does not require very long time series to make an accurate estimation. Applying a wavelet transform to the results also reveals the full range of temporal scales of the interactions.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Causation in Chaotic Dynamic Systems</h2>
<p><em>Palus Abstract</em></p>
<p>Using several methods for detection of causality in time series we show in a numerical study that coupled
chaotic dynamical systems violate the first principle of Granger causality that the cause precedes the effect.
While such a violation can be observed in formal applications of time series analysis methods, it cannot occur in
nature, due to the relation between entropy production and temporal irreversibility. The obtained knowledge,
however, can help to understand the type of causal relations observed in experimental data, namely can help
to distinguish linear transfer of time-delayed signals from nonlinear interactions. We illustrate these findings
in causality detected in experimental time series from the climate system and mammalian cardio-respiratory
interactions.</p>
<p><em>Palus Memo</em></p>
<p>Chaotic dynami-
cal systems are mathematical models reflecting
very complicated behaviour. Recently, cooperative
phenomena have been observed in coupled
chaotic systems due to their ability to synchronize.
On the way to synchronization, the question
which system influences other systems emerges.
To answer this question, researches successfully
applied the Granger causality methods. In this
study we demonstrate that chaotic dynamical systems
do not respect the principle of the effect fol-
lowing the cause. We explain, however, that such
principle violation cannot occur in nature, only in
mathematical models which, on the other hand,
can help us to understand the mechanisms behind
the experimentally observed causalities.</p>
<p>Probably the first approach to de-
scribe causality in measurable, mathematically expressible
terms can be traced to the 1950’s work of the father
of cybernetics, Norbert Wiener 1 who wrote: For two
simultaneously measured signals, if we can predict the first
signal better by using the past information from the second one than by using the information without it, then we
call the second signal causal to the first one. Later, this
concept has been introduced into time series analysis by
C. W. J. Granger, the 2003 Nobel prize winner in economy.
In his Nobel lecture 2 he recalled the inspiration by
the Wiener’s work and identified two components of the
statement about causality:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The cause occurs before the effect; and</p></li>
<li><p>The cause contains information about the effect</p></li>
</ol>
<p>that is unique, and is in no other variable.
According to Granger, a consequence of these statements
is that the causal variable can help to forecast
the effect variable after other data has been first used. 2
This restricted sense of causality, referred to as Granger
causality, GC thereafter, characterizes the extent to
which a process <span class="math inline">\(X_t\)</span> is leading another process, <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span> , and
builds upon the notion of incremental predictability. It
is said that the process <span class="math inline">\(X_t\)</span> Granger causes process <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span> if
future values of <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span> can be better predicted using the past
values of <span class="math inline">\(X_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span> rather then only past values of <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span> .</p>
<p>Due to possible nonlinear dependence in time series from
real-world processes, many authors have proposed vari-
ous nonlinear generalizations of the GC principle.</p>
<p>In the
following we will particularly discuss the generalization
of GC based on probability functionals from information
theory. The information-theoretic functionals, in their
general formulation, are applicable to a broad range of
nonlinear processes, however, we will focus on time
series generated by nonlinear, possibly chaotic dynamical
systems. The observation that the chaotic dynamical systems
generate information had led to an interesting and
fruitful symbiosis of ergodic theory of dynamical systems
and information theory.</p>
<p>that chaotic systems are not reversible in time.
Therefore the observed violation of the causality principle can
occur only in a numerical study but not in real-world
systems. The time reversal in causality analysis can help
to distinguish between a linear transfer of a time-delayed
signal and nonlinear interactions of dynamical systems.
Any detection of causality, however, should be accompa-
nied by a battery of time series analysis methods, namely
tests for nonlinearity and synchronization should be performed,
as well as standard spectral analysis enhanced by
time-frequency analysis since causal links can occur in or
between different time scales of multiscale processes</p>
